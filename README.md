# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-the-R-Language


Hello everyone! This is a repository where I'll be presenting introductory knowledge in data visualization and analysis using the R language.

Data visualization and analysis are fundamental tasks. After cleaning and processing the data, we perform visualization and analysis to relate information and obtain valuable insights.

For this material, I used a basic dataset containing city, GDP, and expenditure data. Through this dataset, I was able to analyze how the data is distributed using graphs and also to relate information. This allows for making data-driven decisions.
